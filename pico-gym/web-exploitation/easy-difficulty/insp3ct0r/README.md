## Goal

Get the flag by examining the source code.

## My Solution

This challenge is similar to the Scavenger Hunt Web Challenge. We have to find 3 parts of the flag. View page source of the `index.html` got the first part:

```html
<!-- Html is neat. Anyways have 1/3 of the flag: picoCTF{tru3_d3 -->
```

The second part is in `mycss.css`:

```css
/* You need CSS to make pretty pages. Here's part 2/3 of the flag: t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t */
```

The last part is in `myjs.js`:

```javascript
/* Javascript sure is neat. Anyways part 3/3 of the flag: _lucky?f10be399} */
```

Final flag: `picoCTF{tru3_d3t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t_lucky?f10be399}`
