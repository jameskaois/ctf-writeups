## Goal

Inspecting the website to get the flag.

## My Solution

The description of the challenge is clear we have to use the inspector to solve this challenge. In the home page click `View page source`:

But got nothing, tried inspecting the `about.html` page:

We got a hint:

```html
<section
  class="about"
  notify_true="cGljb0NURnt3ZWJfc3VjYzNzc2Z1bGx5X2QzYzBkZWRfZGYwZGE3Mjd9"
></section>
```

I tried decode with base64 that string and got the flag:
